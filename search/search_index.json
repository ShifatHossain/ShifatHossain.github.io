The control system for this machine was designed based on Arduino and Siemens LOGO! PLC. [ Project Link ] IR LED based Heart Rate Measurement device (2015) Designed a low-cost Arduino-based photoplethysmograph device during undergraduate studies. It was designed to measure the blood flow in the reflection form. IR light was emitted from the soft-side of the fingertip and this signal was sensed using an IR sensor, separated about 3mm from the IR light generator in the same plane. [ Project Link ] DESIGNING OF A CNC ROUTER FOR PCB DESIGN (2015) Designed a 3-axis CNC router for PCB etching during undergraduate studies. Cassis modelled with steel sheets and used 3 servo motors to control the 3 axes. The servo motors were controlled by Arduino Due (32-bit ARM SAM microcontroller). And the CNC controller was developed using MATLAB which communicated with the microcontroller using USB serial ports. [ Project Link ] 4-WHEELER DIFFERENTIAL DRIVE COMBAT BOT WITH ACTIVE WEDGE (2014) Designed a 4 wheeler combat bot having an active wedge to defeat other bots.
